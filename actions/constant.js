Extra points are accumulated for each improvement in test results across the four language abilities (speaking, listening, reading, writing), but the magic threshold is when a candidate achieves a Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) level of 9 in each ability.  If you ever studied French at school, or otherwise have a decent knowledge of the language, it may be wise to consider preparing to take the Test d’évaluation du français (TEF).</p>",
